# Murkmod After The Storm

When I say storm I'm talking about Murkmod not working (for me at least) on version 116+, it works on older versions only, this code is very basic so dont expect it to 100% work but I'd say this is better since at least it works (to my knowledge) since its working on my chromebook. I don't own murkmod and I don't even know Rainestorme so dont talk to me about Murkmods issues, I'm not smart so dont even talk to me at all really lmao, if you have an issue make an issue real quick and i'll try to fix it. have a nice day!

# ALL CREDITS TO 'rainestorme' and r58Playz !!!!!

I own nothing of this project this is JUST a fork!

# murkmod

murkmod is a continuation of fakemurk and mush that includes additional useful utilities, with the most prominent being a plugin manager.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> You should have unblocked developer mode in some capacity before following the instructions below, most likely by setting your GBB flags to `0x8000`, `0x8090`, or `0x8091`.

Enter developer mode (either while enrolled or unenrolled) and boot into ChromeOS. Connect to WiFi, but don't log in. Open VT2 by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+F2 (Forward)` and log in as `root`. Run the following command:

First install Fakemurk!

run this command: 

bash <(curl -SLk https://bit.ly/fakemurk)

if that doesnt work then use the normal fakemurk command, which is this:

bash <(curl -SLk https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk/releases/latest/download/fakemurk.sh)

After you restart then use the commands below! (you can use tinyurl to make a shortened url or bit.ly)

```sh
bash <(curl -SLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notnrbtw/murkmod-beta/refs/heads/main/murkmod.sh)

If you dont want to use that URL because its too long make a bit.ly link, I might make a bit.ly link later on as well but I'm lazy so I don't know.
```
If this doesnt work make sure yoou're in root (aka make sure your user name is RED ! not Green in VT-2 Terminal)


Select the chromeOS milestone you want to install with murkmod. The script will then automatically download the correct recovery image, patch it, and install it to your device. Once the installation is complete, the system will reboot into a murkmod-patched rootfs.

If initial enrollment after installation fails after a long wait with an error about enrollment certificates, DON'T PANIC! This is normal. Perform an EC reset (`Refresh+Power`) and press space and then enter to *disable developer mode*. As soon as the screen backlight turns off, perform another EC reset and wait for the "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen to appear. Enter recovery mode (`Esc+Refresh+Power`) and press Ctrl+D and enter to enable developer mode, then enroll again. This time it should succeed.

It is also highly reccomended to install the murkmod helper extension. To do so:

- Download the repo from [here](https://codeload.github.com/rainestorme/murkmod/zip/refs/heads/main).
- Unzip the `helper` folder and place it in your Downloads folder on your Chromebook. Do not rename it.
- Go to `chrome://extensions` and enable developer mode, then select "Load unpacked" and select the `helper` folder.
